This repository contains my exploration on high performance algorithms and data structures, which is pretty interesting but hard to be excellent on.

Currently, this repository contains these parts:

+ branchless programming

+ gcd algorithm

+ integer division

+ integer factorization

+ arg min algorithm

+ prefix sum algorithm

+ matrix multiplication

+ binary search
